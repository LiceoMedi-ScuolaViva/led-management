 * @brief Abstraction for controlling a digital LED using Arduino.
 *
 * @details
 *   Provides an object-oriented interface for digital LED control using Arduino.
 *   The interface includes methods for switching the LED on, off, and toggling
 *   its state. Designed to be minimal, intuitive, and MISRA C:2012 compliant,
 *   this class forms the basis for higher-level actuation logic in embedded systems.
